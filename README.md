A go library for interfacing with Cable Modems.

This currently only works (and has been tested with) an Arris S33 Cable
Modem. If you would like to add support for other cable modems, please
file an Issue or submit a pull request with details for further discussion.

If you're looking for a command-line interface to use this library, please
see [`cablemodemcli`](https://github.com/Tuxdude/cablemodemcli).
